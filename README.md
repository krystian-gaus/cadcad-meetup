# cadcad-meetup

The notebook was part of a cadCAD meetup with the goal of getting a quick overview of the basics of cadCAD engineering.

The associated slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JrsrD-ZEmlOYFujKNsCerULEzFq32gOrZ8wizsbhC_4/edit?usp=sharing).

The example presented is inspired by the [cadCAD Complete Foundations Bootcamp](https://www.cadcad.education/course/bootcamp) from [cadCAD Edu](https://www.cadcad.education/). Highly recommended!
